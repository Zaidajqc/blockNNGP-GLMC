# GLMC-blockNNGP 

## Zaida Quiroz, Marcos Prates and Carlos Pizango.

We provide the R code needed to run  the application of Generalized Linear model of coregionalization through block-NNGP using Integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA). 

You have to add "INLA"  from https://www.r-inla.org/download-install.  Main code (with example usage) is denoted by [main]. 


- [main]runGLMC_sim1.R: simulate  data and fit the  models to the simulated data.
- find neighbor.R:  auxiliary functions.
