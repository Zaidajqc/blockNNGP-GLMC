# Full Multilevel block-NNGP 

## Zaida Quiroz, Marcos Prates, Zhiyong Hu and Dipak Dey.

We provide the R code needed to run  simulations of generalized full multilevel block-NNGP models using Integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA). 

You have to add "INLA"  from https://www.r-inla.org/download-install.  Main code (with example usage) is denoted by [main]. 


- [main]runfullMultilevel.R: simulate  data and fit the  models to the simulated data.
- find neighbor.R:  auxiliary functions.
