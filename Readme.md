# Fast  blockNNGP-GLMC Modeling through INLA

R code needed to run the  application study of generalized linear model of coregionalization (blockNNGP-GLMC)  model using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) as proposed in "Fast Bayesian inference of generalized linear blockNNGP model of coregionalization through INLA" by   Zaida Quiroz, Marcos Prates and Carlos Gonz√°les (https://....).
